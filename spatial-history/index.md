# Hanseatic Trade Connections

While the Hanseatic League was not officially founded as a trade federation until 1356, the trade routes between many of the cities that would become members (and the cities that had permanent trading posts – called kontore – of the Hanseatic League but were not formal members) had been a strong connection since at least the 12th century CE. Throughout the 14th century, it expanded to encompass at least 100 cities (some figures go as high as 194, but I was unable to find a comprehensive list with that many members from a reliable source; since largest list I could find, from the website hanse.org, includes every city where there was a kontore as a member city, I think the highest numbers may be due to confusion between trade connections and membership).

The map marks the extent of these main trade connections in the form of a polygon bounded by the furthest Hanseatic League member cities and kontore-having cities (Natkiel, p. 33)](https://archive.org/details/atlasofmaritimeh0000natk/page/33/mode/2up): London in the west, Veliky Novgorod in the east, Krakow in the south, and Bergen and Turku in the north (as marking either of those cities alone would exclude the other from the shaded area). As trade did not take place exclusively in a set order from one end to the other, this shaded area stands in for a variety of trade routes both maritime and land-based.
