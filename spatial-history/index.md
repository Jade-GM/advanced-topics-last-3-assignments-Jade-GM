# Hanseatic Trade Connections

While the Hanseatic League was not officially founded as a trade federation until 1356, the trade routes between many of the cities that would become members (and the cities that had permanent trading posts – called <em>kontore</em> – of the Hanseatic League but were not formal members) had been a strong connection since at least the 12th century CE. Throughout the 14th century, it expanded to encompass at least 100 cities (some figures go as high as 194, but I was unable to find a comprehensive list with that many members from a reliable source; since largest list I could find, from the website hanse.org, includes every city where there was a <em>kontore</em> as a member city, I think the highest numbers may be due to confusion between trade connections and membership).

The map marks the extent of these main trade connections in the form of a polygon bounded by the furthest Hanseatic League member cities and <em>kontore</em>-having cities [(Natkiel, p. 33)](https://archive.org/details/atlasofmaritimeh0000natk/page/33/mode/2up): London in the west, Veliky Novgorod in the east, Krakow in the south, and Bergen and Turku in the north (as marking either of those cities alone would exclude the other from the shaded area). As trade did not take place exclusively in a set order from one end to the other, this shaded area stands in for a variety of trade routes both maritime and land-based.


# Plague Transmission and Fur/Textile Trades

The two main types of plague caused by Y. pestis are spread by ectoparasites (fleas, lice, and ticks) or by airborne transmission. (Septicaemic plague, the third type, is comparatively rare and so fatal in the absence of antibiotics that it does not spread very effectively.) Markets of 14th century Europe would generally have been conducive to both of these methods, as buyers and sellers would have been in close proximity, coughing and breathing on each other as they exchanged goods that might also carry plague-infected ectoparasites. In particular, two major goods traded by the Hanseatic League were textiles and furs, which are vulnerable to infestation from pests – especially the latter, as the thick hairs common to many commercially valued pelts provide good insulation from cold temperatures (to which fleas in particular are extremely susceptible). This may have contributed to springtime outbreaks in colder places such as Bergen, which has spring temperatures in line with the winter lows further south that usually paused plague outbreaks. Lübeck, another fairly cold Hanseatic city that first encountered plague in 1349, also had many plague cases in the late fall throughout the rest of the 14th century and beyond [(Cohn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2630035/).
