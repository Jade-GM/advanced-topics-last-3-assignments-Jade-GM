# Yersinia Pestis Exports: Exploring the Spread of Plague in the Hanseatic League, 1348-1352

Trade routes in general played a major role in the spread of the Black Death pandemic through Europe in the mid 14th century, as the plagues caused by Yersinia pestis are most effectively transmitted via close human contact and trade was a major reason for travel. This essay and the attached map seek to illustrate a connection specifically between the trade connections of the Hanseatic League and the spread of plague through Northern Europe by using available data on the membership of cities (from Richard Natkielâ€™s Atlas of Maritime History) and the year of their first outbreak (from assorted articles and maps).
