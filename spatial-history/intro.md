# Yersinia Pestis Exports: Exploring the Spread of Plague in the Hanseatic League, 1348-1352

Trade routes in general played a major role in the spread of the Black Death pandemic through Europe in the mid 14th century, as the plagues caused by Yersinia pestis are most effectively transmitted via close human contact and trade was a major reason for travel. This essay and the attached map seek to illustrate a connection specifically between the trade connections of the Hanseatic League and the spread of plague through Northern Europe by using data on the membership of cities (from Richard Natkiel’s Atlas of Maritime History) to create the boundaries of the trade area and mapping the year of the first outbreak (from assorted articles and maps) in roughly 20 cities heavily involved in Hanseatic trade within that area.
