## Diabetes and Pharmaceutical Access Barriers in the United States

Diabetes mellitus, better known as simply diabetes, is a chronic disease wherein patients either cannot produce insulin (Type 1) or have an unusual resistance to insulin (Type 2) and as a result cannot regulate their blood glucose levels. Until insulin was isolated in 1922 and refined for medical use in the later 1920s, it was usually managed via a regimen of intermittent fasting and intake monitoring that was often not effective for long in preventing hypoglycemic shock and potentially fatal comas. Although there is still not a cure, insulin injections and blood glucose monitoring can allow people with diabetes to manage the condition and live a long time without experiencing any of the most extreme complications (such as blindness, loss of sensation in the extremities, and muscle weakening). However, access to treatment can be extremely difficult for a variety of reasons, including financial barriers – even in wealthy nations like the USA. Despite insulin having been available as a treatment for nearly a century, there are more recent laws that have made it easier for pharmaceutical companies to increase prices, with the list price of the four most common brands of insulin nearly tripling between 2009 and 2019.

After the successful extraction of insulin in 1922 by Charles Best and Sir Frederick Banting at the University of Toronto, it took just eight years for insulin to become widely available as a treatment for diabetes. Banting refused to sign his name on the patent, which Best and co-patent-holder James Collip sold to the Governors of the University of Toronto for $1 ([something like $15 in modern CAD](https://www.in2013dollars.com/canada/inflation/1923?amount=1)) under the belief that insulin ought to be made available as widely as possible to patients whose lives it could save [(Hegele, p. 324)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(17)30115-8/fulltext). However, insulin prices have increased over time, especially as many companies add more patents for minor changes (which, while initially offering improvements in effectiveness, have recently stopped affecting the potency of the insulin or fast-acting insulin analogue).

One factor that has made it easier to increase the prices of prescription drugs such as insulin is the fact that Medicaid, the USA’s medical insurance program for citizens above the age of 65, has been banned since 2003 from negotiating drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies [(Medicare Modernization Act, p. 117)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-108publ173/html/PLAW-108publ173.htm). That clause was added to the bill in order to get support from Republican senators for having any prescription medication coverage in Medicaid at all, as many Republican senators at the time were generally against government spending on subsidizing healthcare because they felt that it would compromise the free market; prohibiting Medicaid from negotiating meant that having a single government organization covering medications for a very large number of people would not prevent list prices of drugs from rising. Almost immediately after the passage of the bill, politicians such as Senator Thomas Daschle and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi began to talk about pushing for ways to repeal things like the non-interference clause. However, it took nearly four decades to pass a bill adding pharmaceutical coverage to Medicaid at all, and the Medicare Modernization Act included other measures supporting corporate interests, which may be the case again for any bill modifying Medicaid that requires bipartisan support [(Oliver et al.)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690175/).

## The Value of Oral Narratives in Historical Rhetoric

Stories like the one recounted by the Reyes sisters in the StoryCorps interview above are not uncommon in the USA, but there is a difference between seeing statistics and hearing individual accounts. Listening to first-hand experiences being recounted as above demonstrates the importance of re-examining the ways in which the issue of diabetes treatment, which seems like it should be long since solved, from a standpoint of policy and supports. This particular example is not valuable for the historical information and viewpoints it offers as much as for presenting the importance of that historical information and perhaps causing listeners to think about what could be done to change the present based on the combined presentation of contributing factors and personal stories relating to the effects of those factors.

Oral sources like this one may also be more effective because they can help to generate empathy for the experiences of people who would usually just be one of many (a little like private correspondence and diary sources, but with perhaps a stronger effect due to the attention that many people pay to things like tone of voice and speaking speed when deciding to express or act on sympathy), and in the case of discussing diabetes in particular, I think it would be a valuable asset in making a case to a larger audience that might generally not be predisposed to support dedicating more resources to measures that could help with diabetes management. Diabetes is often inaccurately presented as a problem entirely of diet and as an almost voluntary thing - a punishment of sorts for poor lifestyle choices. As a chronic illness that comes with no specific outward signs, it is easy for people - both privately and when engaging in public advocacy - to be unaware of how diabetes affects people who have it and their loved ones. Including firsthand accounts of situations that may occur could help to increase the effectiveness of historical research summaries aimed at the general public.
