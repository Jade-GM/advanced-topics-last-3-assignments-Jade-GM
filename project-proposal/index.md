# Annotated Salernitan Manuscript Translation Database – Pilot Project

## Application for the Hacking History Foundation's Student Development Grant

<!-- I like annotating translations, I like medieval medicine, and I like weird plants and weird calligraphy, so over-all this seems like great fun.-->

### Introduction 
<!-- (500 words) -->

### Methods 
<!-- (500 words) -->

The initial compilation phase of the project will involve contacting collections of scanned manuscripts to request permission for use of their scans, followed by transcribing the scanned images and coming up with a detailed gloss of the language (with notes of any potential ambiguity in words resulting from copying errors or damage) and then an annotated translation in the cases where there is not a freely available pre-existing translation to use.

The results will be made publicly available via a GitHub Page with a purchased domain. Ideally, this will happen on a rolling basis, with each text’s entry being published after its integration into a page in the manner detailed above is complete, so that some part of the project will be available for viewing as early as the third to fourth month. After the project is completed, the results will remain published for at least one year while its success in meeting its goals is evaluated through the writing of a report.

### Timeline
<!-- (500 words) -->

After the end of the twelve-month period, I will generate a report on the project’s success in meeting its goals (as outlined in introduction and elaborated upon in the section following this one), and may seek out other sources of funding based on the findings of that report with regards to the project’s effectiveness at answering the questions from the Introduction section.

### Budget

| Item                                         | Cost (CAD) | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internet                                     | 240        | About $20/month to get increased bandwidth in order to work on the project efficiently and with consistent cloud backups. (I would continue paying for baseline internet independently of the grant, but the increased bandwidth would help to ensure efficiency and reduce downtime while working on the project.)                                                                    |
| External Hard Drive                          | 200        | Maintaining backups in case of unforeseen technical issues will be important. Having all of the project data backed up to an external drive will also mean that it can be transferred and shared more easily in case of future expansion into a larger team project.                                                                                                                   |
| Cloud Storage                                | 220        | See above; maintaining thorough back-ups is important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Domain                                       | 250        | Ideally, the project would stay up on its domain once finished for some time past the end of the grant (to present it in its finished state), so this expense is intended to buy the domain for an additional year.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Reference Text on Medieval Latin Orthography | 190        | I need one or two good and comprehensive volumes compiling the ways Medieval Latin diverges from Classical Latin (as the grammar is largely retained but the orthography and word usage changed sometimes quite significantly), the form of Latin with which I am vastly more comfortable.                                                                                             |
| Person-Hours                                 | 6900       | I estimate that I would use roughly an average of 30 hours per month on the project. In the summer, I would work an extra 100 hours or so. Under Ontario’s current minimum wage laws, it would have to be at least $14.25/hour; I've put it up to $15, adding up to a total of $5,400 for the baseline hours per month across the entire project, plus an extra $1,500 for the summer. |
| Travel                                       | 2500       | Estimated cost of two round-trip flights to cities in Europe (depending on where I can gain permission to go and scan some copies of manuscripts in two different collections).                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Accommodation                                | 800        | Accounting for potential inavailability of return flights the day after the completion of scanning, each trip might take up to four or five days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Portable Scanner                             | 400        | In order to scan manuscripts. (If approval is given, I will first look into the chemistry of common ink and parchment types in order to ensure that nothing bad will happen to the manuscripts from being scanned.)                                                                                                                                                                    |

Their annotations of texts on the mummies and presentation of context with maps is the sort of thing this project intends to do on scans of manuscript texts.
