# The Wild and Wacky World of Plague Remedies

(This fits better with my 355 research, since I switched topics on that last week. There are some things I could think of in terms of producing new research from a project on this, but I think it'd also be very fun as a public-facing database to introduce young people to the fun of pre-modern western European medicine via a topic that everyone sort of vaguely knows and is a hit with the kids (though my childhood interests may not be indicative of what actually is a hit with the kids). I'll check the thingie again except probably not until later because I also have like twelve things due between now and then, including four in the next threeish days.)
